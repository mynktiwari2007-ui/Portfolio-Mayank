## Run Locally

The static website can be opened through a local web server. To test the chatbot, use Vercel's development environment so `/api/chat` is available.

1. Install Node.js and the Vercel CLI.
2. Run `vercel dev` from the project directory.
3. Add `GROQ_API_KEY` to your local Vercel environment. Do not put the secret in frontend files or commit it to GitHub.
4. Open the local URL provided by Vercel.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push the portfolio files to a GitHub repository owned by Mayank.
2. Import that repository into Vercel.
3. In Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables, add `GROQ_API_KEY` with a valid Groq API key.
4. Optionally set `GROQ_MODEL` if a different supported model is required.
5. Redeploy and test search, theme toggle, chatbot, project links, images, and mobile layout.

## Important Before Submission

- Confirm the exact education/institution details with Mayank.
- Confirm whether `pythonbasics-3-25BCON2158` is the correct repository for the separate “Messy Python Code Improvement” practical.
- Add the live Reading List URL if it has been deployed.
- Add the final portfolio's public URL after deployment.
- Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in Vercel; the chatbot will return a configuration error until this is done.
